In this repository, we have performed the end to end Exploratory Data Analysis, and idenfitied the characteristics of the customers that are more likely to churn, and I have used them wisely to create a model, and lately, have deployed the model.
Objectives:
Finding the % of Churn Customers and customers that keep in with the active services.
Analysing the data in terms of various features responsible for customer Churn
Finding a most suited machine learning model for correct classification of Churn and non churn custom.
